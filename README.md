## Problem Statement:

How do we label songs?90’s song or 80’s song. Searching for a song within genre when be- comes easier when we
have an idea what era a song belongs to. Year prediction has not been studied very much. There is huge
untapped potential if we could use year prediction in recommendation system. So in short, an interesting
problem to work on.

 ## Audio Features :

 Features being used are timbre average and covariance of every song, target is the year. For more description about the dataset refer to the url
